# Documentation for the credit program "Linear Equations"

## 1. Introduction and aim of the thesis 
### 1.1. Annotation

The **Linear Equations Solver** solves a user-specified system of linear equations or matrix. The user can choose how they want to enter the system of equations, either in *matrix* or *text* form. It creates a matrix from the input, simplifies it into a graded form, and outputs the solution. 

### 1.2 Exact specification, program goals

The goal of my work was to create a program that can compute a solution from a textual input (5x - 3y = 2, 3x+2y = 10(5 + x) - 3y) or a matrix input that represents a system of linear equations, and output it to the console. 
A text input is an expression containing at most three variables (x,y or z) - this is a way of solving linear equations that is taught in secondary schools. If the text input is a compound expression using, for example, parentheses, the program will modify it into a matrix, which it then calculates. If the user wishes to enter a matrix instead of text, he enters only digits into the console and the matrix is immediately created.
